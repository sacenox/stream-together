# Stream Together

A simple app to live stream with a friend.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env.local` and populate the values using the AgoraIO console: https://console.agora.io/v2

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
